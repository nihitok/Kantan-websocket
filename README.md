Plugin Name

Kantan-websocket

How to use
----------

see http://nihitok.blogspot.com/2011/08/rubygemem-websocketwebsocket.html

Never should a plugin rely on a 3rd party link to explain its behavior or functionality. We need this to ensure that if a website is removed or becomes inaccessible, people can still enjoy your plugins' functionality.

It often includes code snippets, which are just indented pieces of text:

	var script = new MyScript()
	script.doSomething();

Syntax highlighting will be done automatically for you.

Screenshots
-----------

This section is optional, but encouraged if the plugin affords it. Just a list of images, one per line. We do the resizing, so use actual size screenshots.

Arbitrary section
-----------------

This is an arbitrary section. You can have as many of these as you want.
Some arbitrary section examples:

* FAQ
* Notes
* Misc
* Known issues

The name is up to you, but remember to keep it meaningful and simple. Arbitrary sections are always optional.
